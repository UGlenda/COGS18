## About this Project

The goal of this project is to implement C.R.U.D. operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The data that this project focuses on are of musical scores for the Kalimba; a handheld percussion instrument originating from Zimbabwe.

The inspiration for this project comes from a personal need to manage a collection of music charts. The needs that this project addresses are as follows:
 
- ** Curate a list of unique musical scores **:

- ** Recording a relative 'Difficulty Level' attribute **:

- ** Finding specific scores in the list **:
