Glenda Utsler's final project for COGS 18, University of California San Diego (UCSD).

## About this Project

The goal of this project is to implement C.R.U.D. operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The data that this project focuses on are of musical scores. It will be adapted after submission for other key tabs-- specifically, for the Kalimba; a handheld percussion instrument originating from Zimbabwe.

The inspiration for this project comes from a personal need for managing a collection of music charts. The needs that this project addresses are as follows:
- Tests with Imported Music Database Collection
- Create, Read, Update, Delete music_list Features
- Sort Feature (General Queries)
- Song Randomizer
- Ability to Delete All Info (to start over with an empty database)
- CRUD.py, SongRandomizerClass.py

### How to Run the Project

The project requires pandas and pytest. 

### Next Steps 

- Add a transcribing feature to simplify sheet music into letter and number notation for the kalimba.
